# MGLS-5
 **The Minecraft Gang Lasagn Season 5 Texture Pack**

 Made for Minecraft 1.17, this texture pack is a vanilla plus texture pack designed to be used along side the default texture pack and allow for both users with and without the texture pack enjoy the builds created alongside MGLS-5.
 
 *(Has been tested up to the most recent snapshot(21w10a). It is also important to note that I do not own any of the artistic pieces found in `Original Painting Pictures`)*
